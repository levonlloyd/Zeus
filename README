Zeus is a Chrome app for controlling Amazon AWS.  It's properties are

1) It is a replacement for Elasticfox, but aimed at Chrome instead of Firefox

2) It is written in coffeescript.  This should make development and maintainance must easier.

3) It uses jQuery.  This should give it a more attractive User Experience.

4) It has a javascript API for AWS that (will ultimately) stand on its own.


In order to build it,
1) run Cake build in the top level.  This will generate app.js in extension/lib/js
2) Load an unpackaged extension in Chrome.
